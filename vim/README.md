I am wanting to update my vim config from old vim script to lua and also revamp things.
Rather than starting from a blank slate I decided to use [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
Specifically I used the [modular fork of kickstart](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).
But I didnt love the idea of having a fork as my nvim config base directory. I just copied things into my existing dotfiles repo.
